<p>Many fans might have noticed that carnage, unlike venom, is the colour red. The kind of spawn that an evil, twisted demon like carnage would create, however, was enough to scare venom into trying to protect and raise the upcoming spawn himself, especially since. Carnage is basically a venom spawn so they already feel a need to go after their ancestor, but also since he�s bonded to a serial killer with an aligned lust for killing and chaos it strengthens their bond way more compared to the duality between eddie and venom. The film moves at a breakneck speed with little interest in the why. Fan art has shown how he could appear in the sequel. As soon as it was realized that venom could spawn carnage, however, it seemed fairly logical that at some point a story revolving around carnage “giving birth” would be told.</p>
