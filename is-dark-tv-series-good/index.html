</center> <p><strong>Is Dark Tv Series Good</strong>, Dark is a deliciously morbid research on human decisions and their interconnection in between each other and through time. Dark is a netflix series from germany, and it’s impossible to talk about without discussing its central concept, which is revealed within the first few episodes: Where stranger things indulged heavily in period nostalgia and a healthy dose of teen and tween angst and camaraderie, dark is a much drearier, weirder, and darker beast.</p>

<center>Riverdale fans speculate about Dark Betty’s future after From polygon.com</center>
<p>However, i must warn you.it�s also a very difficult show to watch.and it�s not because it�s in german and you must read subtitles. Dark series has really pushed our mind to limits. At its core, dark is primarily concerned with determinism and free will, as so many great time travel stories are. As far as the more sexualized elements of the series, honestly, it’s not as graphic as one might think.</p>

<p>It started from a kidnapping and then into time travel, parallel universe. When two children go missing in a small german town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. As some have said, dark is hard to watch but impossible to stop watching. Dark is a delightfully unsettling series, posing major questions about human nature and paradoxes while also rooting us deeply in small. But as the name suggests, it has a very dark and eerie nature. It revolves around the mysterious disappearance of a child that sets off an ominous time travel conspiracy which spans three generations and threatens to expose the labyrinth of secrets of four families with strained relationships.</p>
